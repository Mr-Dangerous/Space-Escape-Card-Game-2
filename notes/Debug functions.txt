I'm making this small document to document how to use the controls in this game

Pressing the 1 key will begin a new game, so all functinos relating to starting
a new game should be mapped to 1

Pressing the 2 key will lock the planning grid, this will be used
later in code when transitioning to the new attacking state or whatever it is.
